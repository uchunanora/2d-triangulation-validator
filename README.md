Polygonal Sequence-driven Triangulation Validator (PSTV) is an algorithm to ensure the correctness of 2D Delaunay triangulation. It can be easily utilized by installing the C++ header files.


## Features

- PSTV: An algorithm addressing rounding errors in 2D Delaunay triangulation.

- Unique use of floating-point filters over interval arithmetic for efficiency.

- Ensures a posteriori triangulation accuracy and the Delaunay property.

- Method for detecting incorrect triangulations generated by existing software.

- Emphasis on FEM implications of triangulation errors.
